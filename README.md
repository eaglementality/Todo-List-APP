## What i learnt
There were challenges concerning the drag and drop using the react-beautiful-dnd lib and with Nextjs as it's an SSR(Server Side Render) which can mess up how some libraries operate.

Why react-beautiful-dnd? I chose this library simply because it offers a good drag and drop experience as it's a higher-level abstraction specifically built for vertical and horizontal lists.

I used (useReducer with useContext) React hook. (the useContext it is not a state management solution by itself, however combining it with the useReucer it became a full state management solution).

Concerning the light/dark toggle it may be other different approaches to build in Nextjs, I chose to build mine with useState and some stringVariables.
